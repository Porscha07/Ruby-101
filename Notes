Ruby is a true OOP(make as reusable or build friendly as possible) ( very difficult to go procedural)
4 TENETS OF OOP
- Encapsulation
-- bundle all data and methods together
--Also  hiding stuff that shouldn't be available 

- Abstraction
-- share what matters, avoid what doesn't

-Inheritance
--super/subclass
---car --> Electic Car
---monster --> Vampire
---Shape --> Square

-Polymorphism
--Allows you to use the same code to do different things
--in terms of inheritance, you have a Shape --> Square, Shape --> Circle
--shape.draw() AS OPPOSED TO  drawSquare(), drawCircle()

Ruby is a general purpose interpreted language(doesn't compile) like node, php, or python.
-C based
- Easy to connect to a DB
- TONS of gems
-- gems are --> node/npm(where you get cool stuff/modules other people have made), apt/ubuntu, brew/Mac,plugin/jQuery
--puts- prints to the screen
-- irb in the terminal will give you the shell.
